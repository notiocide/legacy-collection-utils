# legacy-collection-utils

Kotlin utilities for Java's legacy collections.

Contains extension functions for creating, and converting to:

 - `Dictionary`
 - `Enumeration`
 - `Hashtable`
 - `Properties`
 - `Vector`
 
While the Java Collections Framework is generally recommended for normal use, when working with
old or backwards-compatible frameworks (such as OSGi) these types are still needed.

This artifact targets Java SE 1.6 and uses Kotlin 1.3, and provides a proper OSGi manifest.
